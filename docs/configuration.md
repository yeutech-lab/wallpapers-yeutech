## svg

If you wish to import SVGs as React component **in your application** or in your documentation, you can use [svgr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svgr) webpack.

If you wish to import SVGs as React component **in a module**, you should use a different plugin: [babel-plugin-inline-react-svg](https://github.com/airbnb/babel-plugin-inline-react-svg)
